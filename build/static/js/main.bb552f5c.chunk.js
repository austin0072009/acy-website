In addition, we recognize that persons who use ACY value their privacy. This Privacy Policy together with our Terms of Service governs our collection, processing and use of your Personal Information. By accessing ACY, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n \n\nIf you reside within the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), or Switzerland, ACY will be the data controller responsible for processing Your Information. See the Contact section of this Privacy Policy for details.\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies to the operations of ACY in the European Economic Area (EEA). It gives you rights by operation of the EU GDPR. If you live outside the EEA, ACY will undertake best efforts to give you a similar degree of control over your privacy.\n\n \n\n## Purpose of Privacy Policy\n\nThe purpose of this Privacy Policy is to set out in an accountable and transparent way the collection and use of information by ACY.\n\n \n\n## What information do we collect?\n\nWe collect from you the \u201cPersonal Information\u201d which identifies you personally or by which your identity can reasonably be ascertained. This may include but is not limited to:\n\n-    Full legal name, address for service, e-mail address, phone number, date of birth, photographic identification, government issued identification and other contact details.\n\n-    ACY requires the highest level of browser permissions that could potentially lead to procurement of more Personal Information than enclosed in the definition of Personal Information.\n\n-    World Wide Web related information, including but not limited to IP Addresses, operating system and browser type may be received by ACY as a result of your interactions with ACY.\n\n-    ACY uses Google Analytics for purposes of monitoring web traffic. Any identifying information collected via Google Analytics is controlled by Google.\n\n-    Ethereum blockchain and other public blockchains provide transparency into transactions and ACY is not responsible for preventing or managing information broadcasted on a blockchain.\n\n## What are your information used for?\n\nThe Personal Information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:\n\n-    Provide our services efficiently and effectively;\n\n-    Inform you about lending and financing features;\n\n-    Develop, enhance, market and deliver products and services to you;\n\n-    Understand your needs and your eligibility for products and services;\n\n-    Provide information to you about developments and new products, including changes and enhancements to the Site;\n\n-    Process billing and collection of any fees;\n\n-    Conduct surveys and get feedback from you;\n\n-    Establish and maintain a responsible commercial relationship with you;\n\n-    Provide you with news and other matters of general interest to you as ACY customer;\n\n-    Meet ACY\u2019s legal and regulatory requirements (eg, information required to verify your identity).\n\n \n\n## Protection of Your Personal Information\n\nACY is committed to protecting your privacy. Internally, only a specified number of employees within our business have access to your Personal Information. These employees have duties which reasonably require access to your Personal Information.\n\nACY\u2019s systems and data are constantly under review to ensure that you are getting the best level of service and that market leading security features are in place.\n\nACY reserves the right to retain and share certain Personal Information in order to meet our regulatory and statutory requirements. In addition, ACY reserves the right to retain and share certain Personal Information with our corporate partners, and third parties acting on behalf of ACY.\n\nPersonal Information and other related data may be exported outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside. Your Personal Information may be processed and stored in a foreign country or countries. Under those circumstances, the governments, courts, law enforcement or regulatory agencies of that country or those countries may be able to obtain access to your Personal Information through foreign laws. You need to be aware that the privacy standards of those countries may be lower than those of the jurisdiction in which you reside. You should note that you are not obliged to give your Personal Information to ACY, but if you choose not to do so, we may not be able to provide our services, or your access to our services may be limited.\n\n \n\n## Consent\n\nConsent is required for the collection of Personal Information and the subsequent use of disclosure of Personal Information.

Since its inception, the ACY Protocol has served as trustless and highly decentralized financial infrastructure.\n\nACY has long committed to the ideals of permissionless access, security, and immutability, all indispensable components for a future where anyone in the world can access financial services without fear of discrimination or counterparty risk. Now rivaling centralized incumbents on daily volume, ACY devotes to meet the demand for permissionless financial services.\n\nWhat is more ACY is an anti-robot decentralized exchange. For the first time in the history, investors are able to out-maneuver arbitrage bots and reclaim value previously lost to MEV. In the past, MEV bots were invincible. In this new world created by ACY, investors will now have the upper hand. \n\nACY&apos;s swap transaction is different from any other transactions. When user do swap on ACY, the smart contract will automatically do an arbitrage for the swap, and the benefits will goes to the users and LPs. All of these in one single transaction. This means that any other arbitrage transactions after our swap transaction will have no more arbitrage opportunity.\n\nHaving proven product-market fit for highly decentralized financial infrastructure with a platform that has thrived independently, ACY is particularly well positioned for community-led growth, development, and self-sustainability. \n\nThe introduction of ACY (ERC-20) serves this purpose, enabling shared community ownership and a vibrant, diverse, and dedicated governance system, which will actively guide the protocol towards the future.\n\nACY has always embraced the tenets of neutrality and trust minimization : it is crucial that governance is constrained to where it is strictly necessary. With this in mind, the ACY governance framework is limited to contributing to both protocol development and usage as well as development of the broader ACY ecosystem.\n\nIn doing so, ACY officially enshrines ACY as publicly-owned and self-sustainable infrastructure while continuing to carefully protect its indestructible and autonomous qualities.\n\n<br/>\n\n## ACY Allocation\n\nOur 200,000,000 (200Million) ACY Tokens are distributed as follows:\n\n1) 20% for Contributors - 40,000,000 (40 million)\nThese tokens are rewards for the hard work of the developers, designers, managers, and other team members behind ACY Finance.\n\n2) 15% for ACY Foundation - 30,000,000 (30 million)\nACY Foundation is a non-profit organization to facilitate decentralized decision-making within ACY Finance.
